CODING_TEST
===========

Backup an S3 bucket to a local file.
------------------------------------
Node.js program backup.js to recursively copy the contents of a publicly listable and readable Google S3 bucket and store it in a local tarball.
The directory structure and filenames are preserved

$ node -v 
v10.17.0

1. BUCKET_NAME - nimbella_coding_test

2. Run the program as:

$ node backup.js nimbella_coding_test
OR
$ node backup.js nimactive

3. keyfile.json contains default credentials for nimbella_coding_test bucket

4. backup.js contains the code that is to be executed

5. STEPS
    a. Dowload bucket's file system locally in /tmp/backup folder
        i. If a file/directory errors, ignore, do not include in download and continue
        ii. If directory empty (detected by checking metadata.id to contain '//'), ignore, do not include in download and continue
        iii. Check the file's containing directory, if it does not exist, create the directory (if needed recursively)
        iv. Download the file
    b. Tar the /tmp/backup folder as /tmp/backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.tar

Note:
1. nimbella_coding_test and nimactive behaved a bit differently, especially in case of empty directory.
2. Errors such as not passing bucket name when running the command are caught.
